# Advent of Code

Hey! This repo contains my solutions for the Advent of Code.

I'm using AoC as an opportunity to learn Rust, a language I've been meaning to get into for a while. It's been a fun ride so far!

If you want to get in touch to discuss solutions or to give feedback on my newbie Rust code, feel free to tag me in X or BlueSky. My handle is `@afonsocrg`.
